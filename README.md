# Book Store API

> This project is about creating API end point using Ruby on Rails and deploying the API on heroku. The API has categories and books endpoints. The API is used in my front end React project which is based on an app to create a book store.

## The learning objective of this project are

- Create rails API that returns json data
- Connect react front-end app to rails back-end API
- Use API end-points to get json data
- Fetch data from the API

## Deployment

- Click [here](https://lunar-hotel-backend.herokuapp.com/) to view the deployment of the book store API.

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Rswag
- rspec
- factory_bot_rails
- shoulda matcher
- Faker
- database cleaner
